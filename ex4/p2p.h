 *
 * This file is part of a peer-to-peer system allows sharing of files among 
 * participating clients. It consits of several source files:
 *
 * 1. p2p.h - a common header file.
 * 2. p2pserver.c - the server program, only one of which should be active.
 * 3. p2pclient.c - a client, several copies of which may be active 
 *    concurrently.
 * 
 * The server keeps track of what shareable files exist and which clients have 
 * them. Clients may both offer files for sharing and ask for files to be sent
 * to them. A client may request a peer (another client) to serve it a file it 
 * has; the peer responds using its serving subprocess.
 *
 * The protocol is as follows:
 *
 * 1. A client may send a MSG_NOTIFY message, notifying the server of a file 
 *    at its disposal it is willing to share. The message contains the name of 
 *    the file, the IP address of the client and its port number. (See below.)
 *
 *    The server responds with a MSG_ACK message which contains the client's 
 *    port number. If the client did not specify a port number (port was 0 in 
 *    the MSG_NOTIFY), the server generates a new, unique port number and 
 *    places it in the MSG_ACK message. 
 *
 *    The client should use that port when serving requests from other clients.
 *    Having the port echoed in the MSG_NOTIFY insures that each client is
 *    assigned only one port, upon the first time it notifies the server. 
 *
 * 2. A client may ask the server to see what files are being shared, using
 *    the message MSG_DIRREQ. 
 *
 *    The server responds to this message with MSG_DIRHDR containing the 
 *    number of available files, followed by that number of MSG_DIRENT 
 *    messages. Each MSG_DIRENT message contains the name of a file and the 
 *    IP address and port number of some client having that file. 
 *    If more than one client is known to have the same file, this information 
 *    is conveyed to the requesting client through several MSG_DIRENT 
 *    messages, all bearing the same file name, each specifying one of the 
 *    possible sources to the file.     
 *
 * 3. Any client, say R, may ask any other client, say S, to send it a copy
 *    of a file S may have at its disposal, by using the MSG_FILEREQ message. 
 *    The message contains the name of the file R desires and is sent to the
 *    address and port the server has associated with client S when the latter 
 *    reported having the file.
 *
 *    S responds by sending a MSG_FILESRV message, containing the size of the 
 *    requested file, followed by the contents of the whole file. However, 
 *    S can legitimately indicate a length of zero and send nothing if it so
 *    chooses (because, for example, S no longer posesses a copy of the file,
 *    or it is too busy.)
 * 
 *    R may, in this case, try a different client from among those listed by 
 *    the server as associated with the requested file. 
 *
 *    It is expected of clients which have successfully obtained a file from a 
 *    peer to register themselves with the server as now having that file too.
